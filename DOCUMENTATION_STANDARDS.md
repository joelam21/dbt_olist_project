## dbt_olist_project Model & Column Documentation

This document establishes comprehensive documentation requirements for all dbt models, ensuring consistency, clarity, and business value communication.

---

## üìã **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### Model Documentation Template
Every model must include:
1. **Model Description**: Clear business purpose and context
2. **Column Descriptions**: Business meaning for every column
3. **Meta Information**: Owner, maturity level, update frequency
4. **Test Coverage**: Appropriate data quality tests
5. **Business Logic**: Complex transformations explained

---

## üéØ **MODEL DESCRIPTION STANDARDS**

### Required Elements
```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    description: |
      **Business Purpose**: Central fact table containing one record per customer order

      **Data Scope**: All orders from the Olist e-commerce platform since 2016

      **Update Frequency**: Daily incremental load at 6 AM UTC

      **Business Rules**:
      - Only includes orders with 'delivered' or 'shipped' status
      - Order totals include product price + freight value + any applicable taxes
      - Cancelled orders are excluded from this model

      **Key Business Questions Answered**:
      - What is our daily/monthly revenue trend?
      - Which customers are our highest value?
      - What's the average order value by region?

      **Data Quality Notes**:
      - Primary key: order_id (unique across all time)
      - Foreign keys validated against dim_customers and dim_products
      - All monetary values in Brazilian Real (BRL)
```

### Description Content Guidelines
- **Start with business purpose**: Why does this model exist?
- **Explain scope and filters**: What data is included/excluded?
- **Document business rules**: How are calculations performed?
- **Note data freshness**: When is it updated?
- **Include business context**: How is it used in decision-making?

## üìä **COLUMN DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS**

### Documentation Block Strategy
**Best Practice**: Use `{{ doc() }}` blocks for reusable column descriptions to maintain consistency across models.

#### Benefits of `{{ doc() }}` blocks:
- **Consistency**: Same description for the same concept across all models
- **Maintainability**: Update once, apply everywhere
- **DRY Principle**: Don't repeat yourself in documentation
- **Team Efficiency**: Shared vocabulary and definitions

#### Documentation Block Location
```
models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ column_descriptions.md   # All {{ doc() }} blocks defined here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _models.yml             # References {{ doc() }} blocks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ marts/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _models.yml             # References {{ doc() }} blocks
```

### Standard Column Descriptions

#### Primary Keys
```yaml
- name: order_id
  description: "{{ doc('order_id_pk') }}"

    - unique
    - not_null
```

#### Foreign Keys
```yaml
- name: customer_id
  description: "{{ doc('customer_id_fk') }}"
  tests:
    - not_null
    - relationships:
        to: ref('dim_customers')
        field: customer_id
```

#### Reusable Business Concepts
```yaml
# Use doc blocks for concepts that appear across models
- name: order_status_category
  description: "{{ doc('order_status_category') }}"

- name: is_order_completed
  description: "{{ doc('is_order_completed') }}"
```

#### Model-Specific Descriptions
```yaml
# Use inline descriptions for model-specific derived fields
- name: model_specific_calculation
  description: |
    Complex calculation specific to this model only.
    Formula: (field_a * field_b) / field_c
    Used only in this particular business context.
```

Frequency: Run on every dbt model execution
Owner: finance-team@company.com

    , total_order_value as order_total
    , calculated_total
    , abs(total_order_value - calculated_total) as difference

    select
        o.order_id
        , o.total_order_value
        , sum(oi.item_price * oi.quantity) + o.freight_value as calculated_total
