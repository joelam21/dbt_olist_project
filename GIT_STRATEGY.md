# Git Branching Strategy - dbt_olist_project

## Overview
This document outlines the Git branching strategy for the dbt_olist_project to ensure clean, organized development workflow and proper environment separation.

## Branch Structure

### Core Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code only
  - Protected branch
  - All code here should be deployment-ready
  - Only updated via pull requests from `develop`
  - Used for production deployments

- **`develop`** - Integration branch for ongoing development
  - Where features are integrated and tested together
  - Should always be in a deployable state
  - Used for development environment deployments
  - Source for feature branches

### Working Branches
- **`feature/<feature-name>`** - Individual feature development
  - Branch from `develop`
  - Merge back to `develop` via pull request
  - Examples: `feature/customer-segmentation`, `feature/order-metrics`

- **`hotfix/<issue-name>`** - Critical production fixes
  - Branch from `main`
  - Merge to both `main` and `develop`
  - For urgent production issues only

## Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Develop and commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. Push and create pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR to develop branch
   ```

4. After review and approval, merge to `develop`

### Release Process
1. Test thoroughly in `develop` branch
2. Create pull request from `develop` to `main`
3. Deploy to production after merge

### Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-fix
   ```

2. Fix issue and test
3. Merge to `main` first, then to `develop`

## Commit Message Convention
Use conventional commits for clear history:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `style:` - Code formatting
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add customer lifetime value model
fix: correct date formatting in orders staging
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

## Environment Mapping
- **Development Environment** ‚Üê `develop` branch
- **Production Environment** ‚Üê `main` branch

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Repository initialized
- ‚úÖ `main` branch created with initial commit
- ‚úÖ `develop` branch created and checked out
- üîÑ Currently on `develop` branch for ongoing development

## Step 1: Start a New Feature Branch from `develop`

# Git workflow
## A. Switch to the `develop` branch
```sh
git checkout develop
```
- What it does: switches your working directory to the develop branch.

- Why: In team/enterprise workflows, develop is typically the integration branch where all new features are built and tested before merging to main (production). Starting from develop ensures your new feature branch has the latest shared work.

```sh
git pull origin develop
```
- What it does: Updates your local develop branch with any changes that have been pushed by teammates to the remote repository (on GitHub) since you last checked.

- Why: Ensures your starting point includes the very latest code, reducing merge conflicts and making sure you‚Äôre building on top of the most current codebase.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/next-feature
```
- What it does: Creates a new branch called `feature/next-feature` and immediately switches you to that branch. The `-b` flag tells git to ‚Äúcreate branch and switch.‚Äù

- Why: All new work (features, bugfixes, enhancements) should be done on a separate branch‚Äînot directly on develop or main. This makes your changes isolated, testable, and reviewable before they‚Äôre merged into the main codebase.

    Naming convention: feature/ prefix clearly marks this as a feature branch; next-feature should be replaced with a short, descriptive name (e.g., feature/add-user-auth).

## Next Steps
1. Set up remote repository (GitHub/GitLab)
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Set up automated CI/CD pipelines
4. Create pull request templates
